[[introduction_ocpi_2.3.0]]
=== OCPI 2.3.0

OCPI 2.3.0 is a release with only the minimal changes to 2.2.1 that are
necessary to meet two requirements: first, to comply with new laws and
regulations coming into effect in 2025, and second, to provide room for custom
extensions to OCPI without breaking compatibility without other implementers.

The changes that are made to address these requirements are:

 * make it possible to define extra modules, fields, enumeration values for certain enums,
 * add a vehicle types field to the EVSE object,
 * support EVSE information for people with disabilities,
 * support North American tax structures,
 * include some straightforward enumeration values from the OCPI 3.0 draft, including the ones indicating ISO 15118 support, and
 * add a new field in the Credentials object to give a hub's party ID, which allows platforms with hub support to connect to platforms that don't implement hub functionality.

[[introduction_ocpi_2.2.1]]
=== OCPI 2.2.1

During implementation of OCPI 2.2 some issues where found that required updating the protocol to fix them.
These are all minor changes, so most OCPI 2.2 implementations would need no, or only minor changes, to upgrade to OCPI 2.2.1.

[[introduction_introduction_and_background]]
=== Introduction and background

The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) enables a scalable, automated EV roaming setup between Charge Point Operators and e-Mobility Service Providers.
It supports authorization, charge point information exchange (including live status updates and transaction events),
charge detail record exchange, remote charge point commands and the exchange of smart-charging related information between parties.

It offers market participants in EV an attractive and scalable solution for (international) roaming between networks,
avoiding the costs and innovation-limiting complexities involved with today's non-automated solutions or with central roaming hubs.
As such it helps to enable EV drivers to charge everywhere in a fully-informed way,
helps the market to develop quickly and helps market players to execute their business models in the best way.

What does it offer (main functionality):

* A good roaming system (for bilateral usage and/or via a Roaming Hub).
* Real-time information about location, availability and price.
* A uniform way of exchanging data (Notification Data Records and Charge Data Records), before during and after the transaction.
* Remote mobile support to access any Charge Point without pre-registration.

This document describes a combined set of standards based on the work done in the past. Next to that,
the evolution of these standards and their use are taken into account and some elements have been updated to match current use.

*OCPI is developed with support of:*
