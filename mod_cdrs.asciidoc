[[mod_cdrs_cdrs_module]]
== _CDRs_ module

*Module Identifier: `cdrs`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

A *Charge Detail Record* is the description of a concluded charging session. The CDR is the only billing-relevant object.
CDRs are sent from the CPO to the eMSP after the charging session has ended.
Although there is no requirement to send CDRs in (semi-) realtime, it is seen as good practice to send them as soon as possible.
But if there is an agreement between parties to send them, for example, once a month, that is also allowed by OCPI.

[[mod_cdrs_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

CDRs are created by the CPO. They most likely will be sent only to the eMSP that needs to pay the bill of the underlying charging session.
Because a CDR is for billing purposes, it cannot be changed or replaced once sent to the eMSP. Changes are simply not allowed.
Instead, a <<mod_cdrs_credit_cdrs,Credit CDR>> can be sent.

CDRs may be send for charging locations that have not been published via the <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_locations_module,Location>> module.
This is typically for home chargers.


[[mod_cdrs_credit_cdrs]]
==== Credit CDRs

As CDRs are used for billing and can be seen as a kind of invoice, they cannot be deleted. Instead, they have to be credited.

When a CPO wants to make changes to a CDR that was already sent to the eMSP, the CPO has to send a Credit CDR for the first CDR.
This credit CDR SHALL have a different CDR.id which can be a completely different number,
or it can be the id of the original CDR with something appended like for example: `-C` to make it unique again.
To indicate that a CDR is a Credit CDR, the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit`>> field has to be set to `true`.
The Credit CDR references the old CDR via the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit_reference_id`>> field,
which SHALL contain the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`id`>> of the original CDR.
The Credit CDR will contain all the data of the original CDR.
Only the values in the <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`total_cost`>> field SHALL contain the negative amounts of the original CDR.

After having sent the Credit CDR, the CPO can send a new CDR with a new unique ID
and the fields: <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit`>> and <<mod_cdrs_cdr_object,`credit_reference_id`>> omitted.

NOTE: How far back in time a CPO can send a Credit CDR is not defined by OCPI.
It is up the business contracts between the different parties involved, as there might be local laws involved etc.


[[mod_cdrs_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the CPO creates CDR(s) they push them to the relevant eMSP by calling <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>> on the eMSPs CDRs endpoint with the newly created CDR(s). A CPO is not required to send _all_ CDRs to _all_ eMSPs, it is allowed to only send CDRs to the eMSP that a CDR is relevant to.

CDRs should contain enough information (dimensions) to allow the eMSP to validate the total cost.
It is advised to send enough information to the eMSP so that they can calculate their own costs for billing their customers.
An eMSP might have a very different contract/pricing model with their EV drivers than the tariff structure of the CPO.

If the CPO, for any reason, wants to view a CDR it has posted to an eMSP's system, the CPO can retrieve the CDR by performing a <<mod_cdrs_msp_get_method,GET>> request on the eMSP's CDRs endpoint at the URL returned in the response to the <<mod_cdrs_post_method,POST>>.

[[mod_cdrs_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

eMSPs who do not support the Push model need to call
<<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> on the CPO's CDRs endpoint to receive a list of CDRs.

This <<mod_cdrs_cpo_get_method,GET>> can also be used in combination with the Push model to retrieve CDRs after the system (re-)connects to a CPO, to get a list of CDRs _missed_ during a downtime of the eMSP's system.

A CPO is not required to return all known CDRs, the CPO is allowed to return only the CDRs that are relevant for the requesting eMSP.

[[mod_cdrs_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and Endpoints

There are both, a Sender and a Receiver interface for CDRs. Depending on business requirements, parties can decide to use
the Sender Interface (Pull model), or the Receiver Interface (Push model), or both.
Push is the preferred model to use, because the Receiver will receive CDRs in semi-realtime when they are created by the CPO.

[[mod_cdrs_cpo_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

The CDRs endpoint can be used to retrieve CDRs.

[[mod_cdrs_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_cdrs_cdr_object]]
==== _CDR_ Object

The _CDR_ object describes the charging session and its costs, how these costs are composed, etc.

The CDR object is different from the <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> object.
The <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_session_object,Session>> object is dynamic as it reflects the current state of the charging session.
The information is meant to be viewed by the driver while the charging session is ongoing.

The CDR on the other hand can be thought of as _sealed_,
preserving the information valid at the moment in time the underlying session was started.
This is a requirement of the main use case for CDRs, namely invoicing.
If e.g. a street is renamed the day after a session took place, the driver should be presented with the name valid at the time the session was started.
This guarantees that the CDR will be recognized as correct by the driver and is not going to be contested.

The _CDR_ object shall always contain information like Location, EVSE, Tariffs and Token as they were *at the start* of the charging session.

[[mod_cdrs_charging_period]]
*ChargingPeriod:*
A CPO SHALL at least start (and add) a <<mod_cdrs_chargingperiod_class,ChargingPeriod>> every moment/event that has relevance for the total costs of a CDR.
During a charging session, different parameters change all the time, like the amount of energy used, or the time of day.
These changes can result in another Tariff Element of the Tariff becoming active.
When another Tariff Element becomes active,
the CPO SHALL add a new Charging Period with at least all the relevant information for the change to the other Tariff Element.
The CPO is allowed to add more _in-between_ Charging Periods to a CDR though. Examples of additional Charging Periods:

- When an energy based Tariff changes in price after 17:00. The CPO SHALL start a new Charging Period at 17:00,
which contains at least the energy in kWh consumed until 17:00.
- When the price of a Tariff is higher when the EV is charging faster than 32A,
a new Charging Period SHALL be added the moment the charging power goes over 32A.
This may be a moment that is calculated by the CPO, as the Charge Point might not send the information to the CPO,
but it can be interpolated by the CPO using the metering information before and after that moment.

[[mod_cdrs_step_size]]
*step_size:*
When calculating the cost of a charging session, `step_size` SHALL only be taken into account once per session for
the <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,TariffDimensionType>> <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`ENERGY`>>
and once for <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> and <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>> combined.

`step_size` is not taken into account when switching time based paying for charging to paying for parking (charging has stopped but EV still connected). +
Example: `step_size` for both charging (<<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>>) and parking is 5 minutes. After 21 minutes of charging,
the EV is full but remains connected for 7 more minutes. The cost of charging will be calculated based on 21 minutes (not 25).
The cost of parking will be calculated based on 10 minutes (`step_size` is 5).

`step_size` is not taken into account when switching from (for example) one <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`ENERGY`>>
based tariff element to another. This is also true when switch from one (<<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>>) based tariff element  to another (<<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>>) based tariff element, and one <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> tariff element  to another <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> based tariff element. +
Example: when charging is more expensive after 17:00. The `step_size` of the tariff before 17:00 will not be used when charging starts before 17:00 and ends after 17:00.
Only the `step_size` of the tariff (<<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,PriceComponent>>) after 17:00 is taken into account, for the total of the same amount for the session.

The `step_size` for the <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,PriceComponent>> that is used to calculate the cost of such
a 'last' <<mod_cdrs_chargingperiod_class,ChargingPeriod>> SHALL be used. If the `step_size` differs for
the different <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffelement_class,TariffElements>>,
the `step_size` of the last relevant <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_pricecomponent_class,PriceComponent>> is used.

The `step_size` is not taken into account when switching between two Tariffs +
Example: A driver selects a different <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_set_charging_preferences,Charging Preference>>
<<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_profile_type_enum,`profile_type`>> during an ongoing charging session, the different profile might have a different tariff.

The `step_size` uses the total amount of a certain unit used during a session, not only the last ChargingPeriod.
In other words, when charging tariff per kWh of time differs during a session, the total amount of kWh of time is used in calculations with `step_size`. +
Example: Charging cost 0.20 euro/Wh before 17:00 and 0.27 euro/Wh after 17:00 both have a `step_size` of 500 Wh.
If a driver charges 4.3 kWh before 17:00 and 1.1 kWh after 17:00, a total of 5.4 kWh is charged. The `step_size` rounds this up to 5.5 kWh total.
It does NOT round the energy used after 17:00 to 1.5 kWh.

Example: Charging cost 5 euro/hour before 17:00 and 7 euro/hour after 17:00 both have a `step_size` of 10 minutes.
If a driver charges 6 minutes before 17:00 and 22 minutes after 17:00: a total of 28 minutes charging. The `step_size` rounds this up to 30 minutes total, so 24 minutes after 17:00 will be billed.
It does NOT round the minutes after 17:00 to 30 minutes, which would have made a total of 36 minutes.

In the cases that <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`TIME`>>
and <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_tariffdimensiontype_enum,`PARKING_TIME`>> Tariff Elements are both used, `step_size` is only taken into account for the total parking duration` +
Example: Charging cost 1.00 euro/hour, parking 2.00 euro/hour both have a `step_size` of 10 minutes.
If a driver charges 21 minutes, and keeps his EV connected while it is full for another 16 minutes. The step_size rounds the parking duration up to 20 minutes, making it a total of 41 minutes. Note that the charging duration is not rounded up, as it is followed by another time base period.

|===

NOTE: The actual charging duration (energy being transferred between EVSE and EV) of a charging session can be calculated: `total_charging_time = total_time - total_parking_time`. 

NOTE: Having both a `credit` and a `credit_reference_id` might seem redundant.
But it is seen as an advantage as a boolean flag used in queries is much faster than simple string comparison of references.

NOTE: Different `authorization_reference` values might happen when for example a <<mod_commands.asciidoc#mod_commands_reservenow_object,ReserveNow>>  had a different
`authorization_reference` then the value returned by a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,real-time authorization>>.

NOTE: When no `start_date_time` and/or `end_date_time` is known to the CPO, normally the CPO cannot send the CDR.
If the MSP and CPO both agree that they accept CDRs that miss either or both the `start_date_time` and `end_date_time`,
and local legislation allows billing of sessions where `start_date_time` and/or `end_date_time` are missing.
Then, and only then, the CPO could send a CDR where the `start_date_time` and/or `end_date_time` are set to: "1970-1-1T00:00:00Z.

|===

NOTE: OCPI makes it possible to provide SoC in the Session object.
This information can be useful to show the current State of Charge to an EV driver during charging.
Implementers should be aware that SoC is only available at some DC Chargers.
Which is currently a small amount of the total amount of Charge Points.
Of these DC Chargers, only a small percentage currently provides SoC via OCPP to the CPO.
Then there is also the question if SoC is allowed to be provided to third-parties as it can be seen as privacy-sensitive information.
So if an implementer wants to show SoC in, for example an App, care should be taken,
to make the App work without SoC, as this will probably not always be available.
