[[terminology_roles]]
=== EV Charging Market Roles

In the EV Charging landscape, different market roles can be identified.

[cols="3s,9",options="header"]
|===
|Role  |Description
|CPO   |Charging Point Operator. Operates a network of Charge Points.
|eMSP  |e-Mobility Service Provider. Gives EV drivers access to charging services.
|NAP   |National Access Point. Provides a national database with all (public) charging locations. Information can be sent and retrieved from the NAP. This makes it different from a typical NSP.
|NSP   |Navigation Service Provider. Provides EV drivers with location information of Charge Points. Usually only interested in Location information.
|Roaming Hub |A business that facilitates roaming by offering integration with multiple roaming partners through one technical connection.
|SCSP  |Smart Charging Service Provider. Provides Smart Charging service to other parties. Might use a lot of different inputs to calculate Smart Charging Profiles.
|PTP   |Payment Terminal Provider. Refers to the party operating the payment terminal management system. This can be the terminal vendor (re/seller) and manufacturer
|PSP   |Payment Service Provider. Refers to the party providing acquiring services,
which is typically a bank or institution that accepts and processes electronic payments.
Merchant can enter into a direct contract with an acquirer or use the services of an intermediary (a payment service provider)
|===

Some of these roles can be combined in one company. A Platform can provide service for multiple CPOs or eMSPs,
but also for both eMSPs and CPOs.

OCPI 2.0 and OCPI 2.1.1 had a very strict definition of roles: only CPO and eMSP. But this is rare in the real world,
there are almost no parties that are strictly CPO or eMSP and have their own platform. In the real world, lots of
parties provide service to CPOs that are not running their own platform.
A lot of CPOs are also eMSP. With OCPI 2.1.1 and earlier that meant having to set up an OCPI connection per role.

OCPI 2.2 introduced more roles and abstracts the role from the OCPI connection itself.
OCPI 2.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.0 are described in terms of about Platforms connecting to Platforms.
The Platform itself is not a role. The Platform provides services for 1 or more roles.

Examples of platforms:

* A pure CPO: Not providing services to other CPOs. Not being an eMSP. Running its own software that connects via OCPI. +
  Is defined in OCPI as a Platform has 1 CPO role, the CPO role of that company.
* A Company that has a cloud-based eMSP software solution,
  it offers to companies that want to be eMSP, but don't want to host/run their own software. +
  Is a Platform that has a number of eMSP roles, one for each eMSP the company is providing services for.
  Not for this company itself because the company itself is not an eMSP.
* A Company that operates public Charge Points and also provides eMSP service to EV drivers, running their own software platform. +
  Is seen in OCPI as a Platform that has 2 roles: CPO and eMSP for this company.
* If one the companies above starts to offer their service to other CPOs and eMSP, it is in OCPI still seen as 1 platform.
  This platform then provides multiple CPO and eMSP roles.
* A Roaming Hub is in OCPI terms also a Platform. Other OCPI Platforms can connect to it.

[[terminology_terms]]
=== Terminology

[cols="3s,9",options="header"]
|===
|Term  |Description
|Broadcast Push | When communicating via a Hub, a data owner can do a single call to the Hub, the Hub then calls all receiving systems. +
                  See: <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_message_routing_broadcast_push,Broadcast push>>
|Charge Point |The physical system where an EV can be charged. A Charge Point has one or more EVSEs. Sometimes called Charging Station
|Payment Terminal| A payment terminal allows a merchant to capture card information and to transmit this data to the acquiring party for authorization and finally
to transfer funds to the merchant. In order to provide acquiring services on a payment terminal strict protocols and certifications apply.
|Client Owned Objects | In a normal REST interface the server is the owner of data, when a new resource is created by calling POST, the server creates the URL where the resource can be found by a client. +
                        OCPI is different, in most modules the owner is the party pushing data to a server, to inform them of updates. +
                        For example Locations, the CPO owns a Location (Charge Point), when a new Charge Point is added, the CPO calls PUT on the eMSP systems to inform them about new locations. +
                        See: <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Objects>>
|Configuration Module | OCPI Module needed to setup and maintain OCPI connections, but does not provide information for the EV driver:
                        <<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_endpoint,Credentials>>, <<version_information_endpoint.asciidoc#versions_module,Versions>>
                        and <<mod_hub_client_info.asciidoc#mod_hub_client_info_module,Hub Client Info>>. +
                        Configuration Modules do NOT use message routing.
|Functional Module | OCPI Module that provides functionality/information for the EV Driver, such as: <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_tokens_module,Tokens>>,
                     <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_locations_module,Locations>>, <<mod_cdrs.asciidoc#mod_cdrs_cdrs_module,CDRs>> etc. +
                     Functional Modules use <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_message_routing,message routing>>.
|Hub   |Functionality in an OCPI platform to route OCPI requests and responses based on their content.
|Open Routing Request | This is for Platforms that are connected via a Hub. When a system sends a pull request to the Hub,
                        and does not know, or care about, the owner of information, but asks the Hub to route the GET to the correct Platform.
                        The Hub finds the correct Platform and routes the request to that Platform. +
                        See: <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_message_routing_open_routing_request,Open Routing Request>>
|Platform | Software that provides services via OCPI.
            A platform can provide service for a single eMSP or CPO, or for multiple CPOs or eMSPs. +
            It can even provide services for both eMSPs and CPOs at the same time. +
            A Platform will typically only provide services for a single Roaming Hub, through the Platform's Hub functionality.
|Pull | A system calls GET request to retrieve information from the system that owns the data.
|Push | The system (owning the data) actively calls POST/PUT/PATCH to update other systems with new/updated information.

[[terminology_provider_and_operator_abbreviation]]
=== Provider and Operator abbreviation

In OCPI it is advised to use eMI3/IDACS compliant names for Contract IDs and EVSE IDs. The provider and the operator name is important here,
to target the right provider or operator, they need to be known upfront, at least between the cooperating parties.

In several standards, an issuing authority is mentioned that will keep a central registry of known Providers and Operators.

For more information about the format requirements for Contract IDs and EVSE IDs, and for authorities issuing Party IDs for providers or operators, see the EV Roaming Foundation's webpage on Contract and EVSE IDs: https://evroaming.org/contract-evse-ids/[https://evroaming.org/contract-evse-ids/].


[[terminology_charging_topology]]
=== Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* _Connector_ is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* _EVSE_ is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* _Location_ is a group of one or more EVSEs that belong together geographically or spatially.

.Charging Topology schematic
image::images/topology.svg[Charging Topology schematic]

A Location is typically the exact location of one or more EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage or a gated community. It is up to the CPO to use whatever makes the most sense in a specific situation. Once arrived at the location, any further instructions to reach the EVSE from the Location are stored in the EVSE object itself (such as the floor number, visual identification or manual instructions).

[[terminology_variable_names]]
=== Variable names

To prevent issues with capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but snake_case. All variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a whitespace.

[[terminology_cardinality]]
=== Cardinality

When defining the cardinality of a field, the following symbols are used throughout this document:

[cols="1,9,1",options="header"]
|===
|Symbol |Description |Type
|? |An optional object. If not set, it might be `null`, or the field might be omitted. When the field is set to null or omitted and it has a default value, the value is the default value. |Object
|1 |Required object. |Object
|* |A list of zero or more objects. If empty, it might be `null`, `[]` or the field might be omitted. |[Object]
|+ |A list of at least one object. |[Object]
|===


[[introduction_data_retention]]
=== Data Retention

OCPI does not specify how long a system should store data. Companies are RECOMMENDED to make this part of business contracts.
Parties also will need to oblige to local legislation.

==== Between OCPI version

When a new version of OCPI is implemented, the data exchanged via the old version does not have to be available via the newer version of OCPI.
Hence, the Version end-point will probably have different end-points per version. So when an object is stored with a URL that contains a version,
it is NOT REQUIRED to be available at a URL with a different version number.
