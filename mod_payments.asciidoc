== _Payments_ module

*Module Identifier: `payments`*

*Data owner: `PTP`*

*Type:* Functional Module

This module should support the Payment Terminal use case for direct payment in the roaming world.

image::images/direct_payment_comparison.png[Direct Payment Comparison]
This should show the difference between roaming and an integrated charging station
solution for direct payment support.

The module consists mainly of two objects: Terminal and Financial Advice Confirmation.
A terminal can handle multiple locations and/or EVSEs. It should be able for a CPO
to assign them to a terminal object. At the end of a charging session there should be a
CDR sent. There should be also send a financial-advice-confirmation from the PTP.
This should contain the actual cost and EFT data. This object is only needed if the
CPO creates the invoice.

[[mod_payments_usage_flows]]
=== Usage Flows

[[mod_payments_terminal_assignment_usage_flow]]
=== Terminal Assignment
This flow shows the exchange and the assignment of the terminal object.
This object will be owned and created by the PTP.
After the object was pushed to/pulled by the CPO
there will be the possibility to assign specific locations to this terminal.
This assignment then will be pushed by the CPO to the PTP.

image::images/payment_assign_locations.svg[Terminal Assignment Flow]

[[mod_payments_terminal_activation_usage_flow]]
=== Terminal Activation
This flow shows a possible former activation of a payment terminal.
Usually, this will be needed for payment terminals integrated into a station.
Here the CPO orders a station from the OEM with an integrated payment terminal.
The OEM will provide a reference to the CPO which can then be used for the terminal activation at the PTP.
After the activation, the PTP will create a terminal object on the CPO side.
This activation is needed as the PTP has to do several configuration steps in beforehand, like
acquiring a unique ID for the given installation address.

image::images/payment_terminal_activation.svg[Terminal Activation Flow]

[[mod_payments_transaction_flow]]
=== Transaction
This flow shows a single transaction in total.
After choosing a specific connector on the terminal the PTP
has to pull the current connector information to receive
the applicable tariff_id.
With this id the tariff should be pulled so that it can be shown on the terminal.
Also the tariff is needed to reserve the needed preauth limit (stated in the <<mod_tariffs.asciidoc#mod_tariffs_preauthorize_amount_field,`preauthorize_amount` field of the tariff>>) at the PSP.
When the user accepts the tariff the PTP will reserve the preauth amount at the PTP and a
StartSession command will be sent to the CPO. The PTP will pass an authorization_reference
with this request which will be used as the mapping for the invoice (e.g. as postfix of the invoice URL).
During the session there will be session updates pushed by the CPO if existing.
For stopping the session there are 3 ways:
[start=1]
. can be stopped by the car or by the station
. a StopSession can be sent by the PTP when the preauth limit is reached
. can also be stopped by the CPO backend if the preauth limit is reached

Now the PTP will receive a CDR with an filled invoice_reference_id.
If this id is set then the invoice was created by the CPO,
if not then the invoice will be created by the PTP.
If the CPO creates the invoice, the PTP
has to push a financial-advice-confirmation object after
he has done the capture at the PSP.
When the CPO has received this object the previously created invoice
has to be enriched with the required EFT data.

|PARTIAL_SUCCESS | Used when only part of the transaction amount was approved or when certain conditions of the payment were altered during processing. This might occur in scenarios where the available balance was insufficient for the full requested amount, or specific transaction limits were enforced by the card issuer.
|FAILED | Indicates that the payment capture attempt was unsuccessful. This failure can be due to various reasons such as insufficient funds, card expiration, network issues, or refusal by the card issuer.
