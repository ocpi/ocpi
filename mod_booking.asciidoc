[[mod_bookings_booking_module]]
== _Bookings_ module

*Module Identifier: `Booking`*

*Data owner: `CPO`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Booking module gives eMSPs information about the available booking options the CPO offers.
Further eMSP's can request these time slots.

[[mod_bookings_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle
The Bookings module has two main objects and one with a sub object, <<mod_bookings_booking_object>>, and <<mod_bookings_bookinglocation_object>>.
To make a booking first a BookingLocation should be published to an eMSP or be requested from the CPO backoffice.

The CPO communicates an BookingLocation to the eMSP, the BookingLocation covers the information per location,
and then can either choose to have the possible bookable parking options or provide a list of bookable EVSE uids.

A Booking typically follows the following lifecycle:

- A Booking starts in a `PENDING` state when initially requested by the eMSP.
- From `PENDING`, the CPO can move the booking to:
- `RESERVED` if the booking request is successful.
- `REJECTED` if the requested timeslot or booking option isn't available.
- `FAILED` if there's an error processing the request.
- From `RESERVED`, the Booking can transition to:
- `FULFILLED` when successfully utilized.
- `CANCELED` if the eMSP or CPO cancels the booking.
- `NO_SHOW` if the booking is not utilized within the timeframe specified by the booking terms.

If a booking moves to `CANCELED`, `NO_SHOW`, `REJECTED`, `FAILED`, or `FULFILLED`, it reaches a final state.

The booking terms URL (`booking_terms`) should contain further details, including no-show policies or possible fines.

[[mod_bookings_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

For Booking there is the Receiver and the Sender interface for Bookings. The advised flow is following the push as the main flow of data from the sender to the receiver.
If parties don't want to share all there booking information during operation. It is also possible to pull data through the sender interfaces.

[[mod_sessions_cpo_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

The Bookings interface can be used to retrieve Bookings, BookingLocations and calendars, but also to request a booking or to change a booking. The interface is split up in BookingLocation with Calendar, and Booking interface.
These two objects should provide the functionality needed to facilitate the booking of a location.
