*Document revisions*
There can be multiple documentation revisions of the same version of the OCPI protocol.

The newer documentation revisions of the same protocol version can never change the content of the messages: no new fields or renaming of fields. A new revision can only clarify/fix texts/descriptions and fix typos etc.

These documentation revisions (not the first) will be named: d2, d3, d4 etc.

Examples:

- OCPI 2.1.1 is a different protocol version of OCPI than OCPI 2.1.

- OCPI 2.2-d2 is the same protocol version as OCPI 2.2, but a newer documentation revision.
