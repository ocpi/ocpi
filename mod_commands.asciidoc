== _Commands_ module

*Module Identifier: `commands`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The Commands module enables remote commands to be sent to a Location/EVSE.
The following commands are supported:

- `CANCEL_RESERVATION`
- `RESERVE_NOW`
- `START_SESSION`
- `STOP_SESSION`
- `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR`

See <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>> for a description of the different commands.
_Use the `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` command with care, please read the note at <<mod_commands_commandtype_enum,CommandType>>._ 

*Module dependency:* <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_locations_module,Locations module>>, <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_sessions_module,Sessions module>>

[[mod_commands_flow]]
=== Flow

With the Commands module, commands can be sent from the eMSP, via the CPO to a Charge Point.
Most Charge Points are hooked up to the internet via a relative slow wireless connection. To prevent long blocking calls,
the commands module is designed to work asynchronously.

The Sender (typically eMSP) send a request to a Receiver (typically CPO), via the Receivers Commands interface.
The Receiver checks if it can send the request to a Charge Point and will respond to the request with a status, indicating if the request can be sent to a Charge Point.

The Receiver (typically CPO) sends the requested command (via another protocol, for example: OCPP) to a Charge Point.
The Charge Point will respond if it understands the command and will try to execute the command.
This response doesn't always mean that the command was executed successfully.
The Receiver (typically CPO) will forward the result in a new POST request to the Senders Commands interface.

The following examples try to give insight into the message flow and the asynchronous nature of the OCPI Commands.

Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because EV not plugged in before end of time-out.
This is an example for Charge Point that allows a remote start when the cable is not yet plugged in.
Some Charge Points even require this, there might, for example, be a latch in front of the socket to prevent vandalism.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_timeout.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted, but no new Session is started because the EV is not plugged in,
and this Charge Point does not allow a remote start without a cable already being plugged in.

.START_SESSION failed
image::images/command_start_session_no_cable.svg[START_SESSION failed]


Example of a `START_SESSION` that is accepted and results in a new Session.

.START_SESSION successful
image::images/command_start_session_succesful.svg[START_SESSION successful]


Example of a `START_SESSION` with a Token that is Whitelist: NEVER.

The CPO should not check the Token in the START_SESSION, before sending it to the Charge Point.
The CPO should assume that the eMSP only sends valid Tokens in the START_SESSION object.

If needed, the Charge Point does an OCPP Authorize request to validate the Token (proved via OCPP).
In such case the CPO only does an <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
when the OCPP Authorize request is for an RFID Token and the START_SESSION for this Token was received more then 15 minutes ago.


.START_SESSION whitelist NEVER
image::images/command_start_session_whitelist_never.svg[START_SESSION whitelist NEVER]


Example of a `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` that fails because the Location is not known by the CPO.

.UNLOCK_CONNECTOR Unknown Location
image::images/command_unlock_unknow_location.svg["UNLOCK_CONNECTOR Unknown Location"]


Example of a `RESERVE_NOW` that is rejected by the Charge Point.

.RESERVE_NOW rejected by Charge Point
image::images/command_reservenow_rejected.svg[RESERVE_NEW rejected by Charge Point]

Example of a successful `RESERVE_NOW`.

.Successful RESERVE_NOW
image::images/command_reservenow_successful.svg[Successful RESERVE_NOW]


Reservation canceled by the CPO. +
OCPI makes it possible for a CPO to cancel a reservation.
This is not to be taken lightly. When a driver makes a reservation of a Charge Point/EVSE, he/she wants to be sure to have a charging location.
So if the CPO cancel the reservation, the driver will for sure not like it.
But there are some circumstances where the CPO is forced to cancel a reservation.
For example: Charge Point has become defect, or the CPO is notified of ongoing roadworks which makes the Charge Point unreachable etc.

To Cancel a reservation the CPO call the Senders interface with the same URL as was given by the Sender (eMSP) when the `RESERVE_NOW` command was send.

The sequence diagram below continues after the sequence diagram above.

.Reservation canceled by the CPO
image::images/command_reservenow_canceled_by_cpo.svg[Reservation canceled by the CPO]

These examples use OCPP 1.6 based commands between CPO and Charge Point, but that is not a requirement for OCPI.

If the Sender (typically eMSP) wants to have a reference between the calls sent to the Receivers interface and the asynchronous result received from the Charge Point via the CPO,
the Sender can make some unique identifier part of the`response_url` that is part of every method in the Receiver interface.
The Receiver will call this URL when the result is received from the Charge Point. The Sender can then match the unique identifier from the URL called with the request.

[[mod_commands_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

The commands module consists of two interfaces: a Receiver interface that enables a Sender (typically eMSP) (and its clients) to send commands to a Location/EVSE
and an Sender interface to receive the response from the Location/EVSE asynchronously.

[[mod_commands_cpo_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

Endpoint structure definition:

[[mod_commands_response_data]]
====== Response Data

The response contains the direct response from the Receiver, not the response from the Charge Point itself,
that will be sent via an asynchronous POST on the Sender interface if this response is `ACCEPTED`.

[[mod_commands_emsp_interface]]
==== Sender Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: eMSP.

The Sender interface receives the asynchronous responses.

Endpoint structure definition:

No structure defined. This is open to the Sender to define, the URL is provided to the Receiver by the Sender in the POST to the Receiver interface.
Therefor OCPI does not define variables.

Example:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/commands/{command}+`

`+https://ocpi.server.com/commands/{command}/{uid}+`

[[mod_commands_msp_post_method]]
===== *POST* Method

Endpoint structure definition:

It is up to the implementation of the eMSP to determine what parameters are put in the URL.
The eMSP sends a URL in the POST method body to the CPO. The CPO is required to use this URL for the asynchronous response by the Charge Point.
It is advised to make this URL unique for every request to differentiate simultaneous commands, for example by adding a unique id as a URL segment.

Examples:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/commands/RESERVE_NOW/1234+`

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/emsp/2.2.1/commands/UNLOCK_CONNECTOR/2+`

[[mod_commands_object_description]]
=== Object description

[[mod_commands_cancelreservation_object]]
==== _CancelReservation_ Object

With CancelReservation the Sender can request the Cancel of an existing Reservation.
The CancelReservation needs to contain the `reservation_id` that was given by the Sender to the `ReserveNow`.

As there might be cost involved for a Reservation, canceling a reservation might still result in a CDR being send for the reservation.

[cols="3,2,1,10",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|response_url |<<types.asciidoc#types_url_type,URL>> |1 |URL that the CommandResult POST should be sent to. This URL might contain a unique ID to be able to distinguish between CancelReservation requests.
|reservation_id |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |1 |Reservation id, unique for this reservation. If the Charge Point already has a reservation that matches this reservationId the Charge Point will replace the reservation.
|===


[[mod_commands_commandresponse_object]]
==== _CommandResponse_ Object

The CommandResponse object is send in the HTTP response body.

Because OCPI does not allow/require retries, it could happen that the asynchronous result url given by the eMSP is never successfully called.
The eMSP might have had a glitch, HTTP 500 returned, was offline for a moment etc.
For the eMSP to be able to give a quick as possible response to another system or driver app. It is important for the eMSP to know the timeout on a certain command.

|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|result |<<mod_commands_commandresponsetype_enum,CommandResponseType>> |1 |Response from the CPO on the command request.

|message|<<types.asciidoc#types_displaytext_class,DisplayText>>|*|Human-readable description of the reason (if one can be provided), multiple languages can be provided.
|===


[[mod_commands_reservenow_object]]
==== _ReserveNow_ Object

The `evse_uid` is optional. If no EVSE is specified, the Charge Point should keep one EVSE available for the EV Driver identified by the given Token. (This might not be supported by all Charge Points).
A reservation can be replaced/updated by sending a `RESERVE_NOW` request with the same Location (Charge Point) and the same `reservation_id`.

A successful reservation will result in a new `Session` object being created by the CPO.

An unused Reservation of a Charge Point/EVSE MAY result in cost being made, thus also a CDR.

The eMSP provides a Token that has to be used by the Charge Point.
The Token provided by the eMSP for the `ReserveNow` SHALL be authorized by the eMSP before sending it to the CPO.
Therefor the CPO SHALL NOT check the validity of the Token provided before sending the request to the Charge Point.

If this is an OCPP Charge Point, the Charge Point decides if it needs to validate the given Token, in such case:

- If this Token is of type `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> at the eMSP for this.
- If this Token is of type `RFID`, the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
at the eMSP for this Token at the given EVSE/Charge Point within 15 minutes after having received this `ReserveNow`.

The eMSP MAY use Tokens that have not been pushed via the <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module. This is especially likely with tokens fof types `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER`. Such Tokens are only used in commands sent by an eMSP and never presented locally at the Charge Point by a Driver like `RFID` Tokens.

Unknown Tokens received by the CPO in the `ReserveNow` Object don't need to be stored in the <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module.
In other words, when a Token has been received via `ReserveNow`, the same `Token` does not have to be returned in a Token GET request from the eMSP.

An eMSP sending a `ReserveNow` SHALL only use Tokens that are owned by this eMSP. Using Tokens of other eMSPs is not allowed.

The `reservation_id` sent by the Sender (eMSP) to the Receiver (CPO) SHALL NOT be sent directly to a Charge Point.
The CPO SHALL make sure the Reservation ID sent to the Charge Point is unique and is not used by another Sender (eMSP).
We don't want a Sender (eMSP) to replace or cancel a reservation of another Sender (eMSP).

[cols="4,2,1,9",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|response_url |<<types.asciidoc#types_url_type,URL>> |1 |URL that the CommandResult POST should be sent to. This URL might contain a unique ID to be able to distinguish between ReserveNow requests.
|token |<<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_token_object,Token>> |1 |Token object for how to reserve this Charge Point (and specific EVSE).
|expiry_date |<<types.asciidoc#types_datetime_type,DateTime>> |1 |The Date/Time when this reservation ends, in UTC.
|reservation_id |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |1 |Reservation id, unique for this reservation. If the Receiver (typically CPO) Point already has a reservation that matches this reservationId for that Location it will replace the reservation.
|location_id |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |1 |Location.id of the Location (belonging to the CPO this request is sent to) for which to reserve an EVSE.
|evse_uid |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |? |Optional EVSE.uid of the EVSE of this Location if a specific EVSE has to be reserved.
|authorization_reference |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |? |Reference to the authorization given by the eMSP, when given,
                                             this reference will be provided in the relevant <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_session_object,Session>>
                                             and/or <<mod_cdrs.asciidoc#mod_cdrs_cdr_object,CDR>>.
|===


[[mod_commands_startsession_object]]
==== _StartSession_ Object

The `evse_uid` is optional. If no EVSE is specified, the Charge Point can itself decide on which EVSE to start a new session. (this might not be supported by all Charge Points).

The eMSP provides a Token that has to be used by the Charge Point.
The Token provided by the eMSP for the `StartSession` SHALL be authorized by the eMSP before sending it to the CPO.
Therefor the CPO SHALL NOT check the validity of the Token provided before sending the request to the Charge Point.

If this is an OCPP Charge Point, the Charge Point decides if it needs to validate the given Token, in such case:

- If this Token is of type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
  at the eMSP for this .
- If this Token is of type: `RFID`, the CPO SHALL NOT do a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>>
  at the eMSP for this Token at the given EVSE/Charge Point within 15 minutes after having received this `StartSession`.
(This means that if the driver decided to use his RFID within 15 minutes at the same Charge Point, because the app is not working somehow, the RFID is already authorized)

The eMSP MAY use Tokens that have not been pushed via the <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module,
especially `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` Tokens are only used by commands send by an eMSP. As these are never used locally at the Charge Point like `RFID`.

Unknown Tokens received by the CPO in the `StartSession` Object don't need to be stored in the <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_tokens_module,Token>> module.
In other words, when a Token has been received via `StartSession`, the same `Token` does not have to be returned in a Token GET request from the eMSP.
However, the information of the Token SHALL be put in the `Session` and `CDR`.

An eMSP sending a `StartSession` SHALL only use Token that are owned by this eMSP in `StartSession`, using Tokens of other eMSPs is not allowed.

[cols="4,2,1,9",options="header"]
|===
|Property |Type |Card. |Description

|response_url |<<types.asciidoc#types_url_type,URL>> |1 |URL that the CommandResult POST should be sent to. This URL might contain a unique ID to be able to distinguish between StartSession requests.
|token |<<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_token_object,Token>> |1 |Token object the Charge Point has to use to start a new session. The Token provided in this request is authorized by the eMSP.
|location_id |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |1 |Location.id of the Location (belonging to the CPO this request is sent to) on which a session is to be started.
|evse_uid |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |? |Optional EVSE.uid of the EVSE of this Location on which a session is to be started. Required when `connector_id` is set.
|connector_id |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |? |Optional Connector.id of the Connector of the EVSE on which a session is to be started. This field is required when the capability: <<mod_locations.asciidoc#mod_locations_capability_enum,START_SESSION_CONNECTOR_REQUIRED>> is set on the EVSE.
|authorization_reference |<<types.asciidoc#types_cistring_type,CiString>>(36) |? |Reference to the authorization given by the eMSP, when given,
                                             this reference will be provided in the relevant <<mod_sessions.asciidoc#mod_sessions_session_object,Session>>
                                             and/or <<mod_cdrs.asciidoc#mod_cdrs_cdr_object,CDR>>.
|===

NOTE: In case of an OCPP 1.x Charge Point, the EVSE ID should be mapped to the connector ID of a Charge Point.
OCPP 1.x does not have good support for Charge Points that have multiple connectors per EVSE.
To make StartSession over OCPI work, the CPO SHOULD present the different connectors of an EVSE as separate EVSE,
as is also written by the OCA in the application note: "Multiple Connectors per EVSE in a OCPP 1.x implementation".

The command requested.
[cols="3,10",options="header"]

|Value |Description 

|CANCEL_RESERVATION |Request the Charge Point to cancel a specific reservation.
|RESERVE_NOW |Request the Charge Point to reserve a (specific) EVSE for a Token for a certain time, starting now.
|START_SESSION |Request the Charge Point to start a transaction on the given EVSE/Connector. 
|STOP_SESSION |Request the Charge Point to stop an ongoing session. 
|UNLOCK_CONNECTOR |Request the Charge Point to unlock the connector (if applicable). This functionality is for help desk operators only! 
|===

*The command `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` may only be used by an operator or the eMSP. This command SHALL never be allowed to be sent directly by the EV-Driver.
The `UNLOCK_CONNECTOR` is intended to be used in the rare situation that the connector is not unlocked successfully after a transaction is stopped. The mechanical unlock of the lock mechanism might get stuck, for example: fail when there is tension on the charging cable when the Charge Point tries to unlock the connector.
In such a situation the EV-Driver can call either the CPO or the eMSP to retry the unlocking.*
