Lots of typos fixed and textual improvements. +
Improved/fixed all descriptions and examples with relation to the Tariff `step_size`.

The following changes to messages/objects etc.

|Expected Impact: +
eMSP / CPO
|Expected Effort: +
eMSP / CPO
|Description

|CDRs / +
CDR Object
|Medium / +
Major
|Average / +
Large
|- Added `county_code` and `party_id` fields, making it easier to determine the owner of a CDR. +
- Added `session_id` field, making it easier to match a CDR to a Session. +
- Renamed `stop_date_time` field to `end_date_time`, to bring the naming inline with the rest of OCPI. +
- Changed `total_cost` field from type: `number` to `Price`, this provides the eMSP with the total cost including VAT. +
- Replaced `auth_id` field with `CdrToken`. `auth_id` alone could not be used to uniquely identify a <<mod_tokens.asciidoc#mod_tokens_token_object,Token>>. By copying the information for the dynamic Token object, the CDR will always reflect the 'true' status of Token at the start of the charging session. +
- Replaced `location` field with `cdr_location`, this also changed type, from `Location` to `CdrLocation`. Reusing the `Location` object always caused a lot of confusing, things were not clear. By creating a dedicated object `CdrLocation` with only the relevant fields, things should be much clearer. +
- Added `credit` and `credit_reference_id` fields, to allow for Credit CDRs to be send. +
- Added `total_fixed_cost`, `total_energy_cost`, `total_time_cost`, `total_parking_cost` and `total_reservation_cost` fields, to allow more cost details in the CDRs. +
- Added `authorization_reference` field for binding an authorization to the resulting session. +
- Added `signed_data` field, enabling OCPI to be used to transport signed meter data from the Charge Point to the eMSP and EV driver, can be used for Eichrecht. +
- Added `invoice_reference_id` field (optional), to allow a CDRs to reference an invoice. +
- Field `id` changed in length from 36 to 39, to allow for something to be appended after the original id in case of a Credit CDR.

ChargingPeriod class
|Medium / +
