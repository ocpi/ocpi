== Data Retention

OCPI does not specify how long a system should store data. Companies are RECOMMENDED to make this part of business contracts.
Parties also will need to oblige to local legislation.

=== Between OCPI version

When a new version of OCPI is implemented, the data exchanged via the old version does not have to be available via the newer version of OCPI.
Hence, the Version end-point will probably have different end-points per version. So when an object is stored with a URL that contains a version,
it is NOT REQUIRED to be available at a URL with a different version number.
