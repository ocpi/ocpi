[[mod_tokens_tokens_module]]
== _Tokens_ module

*Module Identifier: `tokens`*

*Data owner: `MSP`*

*Type:* Functional Module

The tokens module gives CPOs knowledge of the token information of an eMSP.
eMSPs can push Token information to CPOs, CPOs can build a cache of known Tokens.
When a request to authorize comes from a Charge Point, the CPO can check against this cache.
With this cached information they know to which eMSP they can later send a CDR. 

[[mod_tokens_flow_and_lifecycle]]
=== Flow and Lifecycle

[[mod_tokens_push_model]]
==== Push model

When the eMSP creates a new Token object they push it to the CPO by calling <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the newly created Token object.

Any changes to Token in the eMSP system are sent to the CPO system by calling either the <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> or the <<mod_tokens_patch_method,PATCH>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the updated Token(s).

When the eMSP invalidates a Token (deleting is not possible), the eMSP will send the updated Token (with the field: valid set to `false`, by calling, either the <<mod_tokens_put_method,PUT>> or the <<mod_tokens_patch_method,PATCH>> on the CPO's Tokens endpoint with the updated Token. 

When the eMSP is not sure about the state or existence of a Token object in the CPO system, the
eMSP can call the <<mod_tokens_cpo_get_method,GET>> to validate the Token object in the CPO system. 

[[mod_tokens_pull_model]]
==== Pull model

When a CPO is not sure about the state of the list of known Tokens, or wants to request the full
list as a start-up of their system, the CPO can call the <<mod_tokens_msp_get_method,GET>> on the eMSP's Token endpoint to receive
all Tokens, updating already known Tokens and adding new received Tokens to it own list of Tokens.
This is not intended for real-time operation, requesting the full list of tokens for every authorization will put to much strain on systems.
It is intended for getting in-sync with the server, or to get a list of all tokens (from a server without Push mode) every X hours.

[[mod_tokens_real-time_authorization]]
==== Real-time authorization

An eMSP might want their Tokens to be authorized 'real-time', not white-listed.
For this the eMSP has to implement the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>>
and set the Token.whitelist field to `NEVER` for Tokens they want to have authorized 'real-time'.

If an eMSP doesn't want real-time authorization, the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>> doesn't
have to be implemented as long as all their Tokens have Token.whitelist set to `ALWAYS`.

When an eMSP does not want to Push the full list of tokens to CPOs,
the CPOs will need to call the <<mod_tokens_post_method,POST Authorize request>> to check if a Token is known by the eMSP, and if it is valid.

NOTE: Doing real-time authorization of RFID will mean a longer delay of the authorization process, which might result in bad user experience at the Charge Point.
So care should be taken to keep delays in processing the request to an absolute minimum.

NOTE: Real-time authorization might be asked for a charging location that is not published via the <<mod_locations_locations_module,Location>> module,
typically a private charger. In most cases this is expected to result in: `ALLOWED`.

NOTE: If real-time authorization is asked for a location, the eMSP SHALL NOT validate that charging is possible based on information like opening hours or EVSE status etc. 
as this information might not be up to date.

[[mod_tokens_interfaces_and_endpoints]]
=== Interfaces and endpoints

There is both a Sender and a Receiver interface for Tokens. It is advised to use the Push direction from Sender to Receiver during normal operation.
The Sender interface is meant to be used when the Receiver is not 100% sure the Token cache is still correct.

[[mod_tokens_cpo_interface]]
==== Receiver Interface

Typically implemented by market roles like: CPO.

With this interface the Sender can push the Token information to the Receiver.
Tokens is a <<transport_and_format.asciidoc#transport_and_format_client_owned_object_push,Client Owned Object>>, so the end-points need to contain the required extra fields: {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,party_id>>} and {<<credentials.asciidoc#credentials_credentials_object,country_code>>}.

Endpoint structure definition:

`{token_endpoint_url}/{country_code}/{party_id}/{token_uid}[?type={type}]`

Example:

`+https://www.server.com/ocpi/cpo/2.2.1/tokens/NL/TNM/012345678+`

[[mod_tokens_cpo_get_method]]
===== *GET* Method

If the eMSP wants to check the status of a Token in the CPO system it might GET the object from the CPO system for validation purposes. The eMSP is the owner of the objects, so it would be illogical if the CPO system had a different status or was missing an object.

                                      If this is a `APP_USER` or `AD_HOC_USER` Token, it will be a uniquely, by the eMSP, generated ID. +
                                      This field is named `uid` instead of `id` to prevent confusion with: `contract_id`.

|===


The combination of _uid_ and _type_ should be unique for every token within the eMSP's system.

NOTE: OCPP supports group_id (or ParentID as it is called in OCPP 1.5/1.6) OCPP 1.5/1.6 only support group ID's with maximum length of string(20), case insensitive.
As long as EV-driver can be expected to charge at an OCPP 1.5/1.6 Charge Point, it is adviced to not used a group_id longer then 20.

==== TokenType _OpenEnum_

[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description 

|AD_HOC_USER |One time use Token ID generated by a server (or App.) The eMSP uses this to bind a Session to a customer, probably an app user.
|APP_USER |Token ID generated by a server (or App.) to identify a user of an App. The same user uses the same Token for every Session.
| EMAID | An EMAID. EMAIDs are used as Tokens when the Charging Station and the vehicle are using ISO 15118 for communication.
|OTHER |Other type of token
|RFID |RFID Token 
|===

NOTE: The eMSP is RECOMMENDED to push Tokens with type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` with `whitelist` set to `NEVER`.
Whitelists are very useful for RFID type Tokens, but the `AD_HOC_USER`/`APP_USER` Tokens are used to start Sessions from an App etc. so whitelisting them has no advantages.

NOTE: The eMSP is RECOMMENDED to not push Tokens with type `EMAID` at all. Exchanging Token objects for EMAID Tokens is not necessary because the CPO already learns which Party issued the Token from the Charging Station. The CPO can then contact this Party for real-time authorization using <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,real-time authorization>>.

NOTE: The management of the contract certificates that are used with ISO 15118 to authenticate the vehicle is left outside of OCPI 2.3.0. There are other existing standards for exchanging and validating certificates that Parties can use to authenticate contract certificates.

[[mod_tokens_whitelisttype_enum]]
==== WhitelistType _enum_

Defines when authorization of a Token by the CPO is allowed.

The validity of a Token has no influence on this. If a Token is: `valid = false`,
when the `whitelist` field requires real-time authorization, the CPO SHALL do a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,real-time authorization>>,
the state of the Token might have changed.

[cols="3,10",options="header"]
|===
|Value |Description 

|ALWAYS |Token always has to be whitelisted, <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> is not possible/allowed. CPO shall always allow any use of this Token.
|ALLOWED |It is allowed to whitelist the token, <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> is also allowed. The CPO may choose which version of authorization to use.
|ALLOWED_OFFLINE |In normal situations <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> shall be used. But when the CPO cannot get a response from the eMSP (communication between CPO and eMSP is offline), the CPO shall allow this Token to be used.
|NEVER |Whitelisting is forbidden, only <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> is allowed. CPO shall always send a <<mod_tokens_real-time_authorization,realtime authorization>> for any use of this Token to the eMSP.
